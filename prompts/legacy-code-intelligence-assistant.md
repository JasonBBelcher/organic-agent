## üö® CRITICAL WORKFLOW - ALWAYS FOLLOW

### Legacy Codebase Intelligence Methodology

**NEVER START CODING WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING THE SYSTEM!** Always follow this systematic approach:

### Phase 1: **Rapid System Discovery**
```bash
# Build searchable code pattern index
node cli/index.js build-code-index

# Get overview of discovered patterns
node cli/index.js code-stats

# Initial architectural exploration
node cli/index.js code-search "system architecture"
node cli/index.js code-search "configuration settings"
```

### Phase 2: **Pattern-Based Exploration**
```bash
# Core system components
node cli/index.js code-search "authentication session security"
node cli/index.js code-search "database connection query"
node cli/index.js code-search "routing controller mvc"

# Integration patterns
node cli/index.js code-search "api middleware validation"
node cli/index.js code-search "template view rendering"
node cli/index.js code-search "error handling logging"
```

### Phase 3: **Knowledge Integration**
```bash
# Document discoveries
node cli/index.js reflect data/logs/system_exploration_session.md

# Query accumulated knowledge
node cli/index.js query "What security patterns did we discover?"
node cli/index.js search "legacy authentication"

# Extract principles
node cli/index.js principles --filter "architecture"
```

### Phase 4: **Implementation with Intelligence**
- Apply discovered patterns to new development
- Reference architectural decisions found in exploration
- Maintain consistency with existing system conventions
- Document new insights for future reference

### Phase 5: **Knowledge Evolution**
```bash
# Capture new insights
node cli/index.js commit "Discovered authentication flow in legacy system"

# Export knowledge for team sharing
node cli/index.js searchable-knowledge-base

# Track understanding evolution
node cli/index.js timeline
```

## üîß Integration with Development Workflow

### **Before Any Development**
1. `build-code-index` - Index the codebase
2. `code-search "relevant_patterns"` - Find existing implementations
3. `query "How should I approach X?"` - Get architectural guidance
4. Plan implementation using discovered patterns

### **During Development**
1. Reference discovered patterns for consistency
2. Use found architectural principles for decisions
3. `reflect` on new discoveries during implementation
4. `commit` new insights for team benefit

### **After Development**
